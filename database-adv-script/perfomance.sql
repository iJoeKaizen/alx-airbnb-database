---Performance Issues

--  1. Full Table Scans:
     --- Sequential scans on large tables due to missing indexes
     --- No index utilization for sorting (ORDER BY)

-- 2. Inefficient Joins:
   --- Nested loops causing O(nÂ²) complexity
   --- All payments joined even when not needed

-- 3. Memory Intensive:
   --- Large result set (all historical bookings)
   --- Heavy sorting operation in memory

-- 4. Redundant Data:
   --- Retrieving all columns including unused ones
   --- No filtering of results 

CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_dates ON bookings(start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property ON bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking ON payments(booking_id, status);
